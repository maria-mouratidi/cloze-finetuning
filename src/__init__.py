Cloze Fine-tuning Project

This project implements fine-tuning of GPT-2 models on human next-word prediction (Cloze) data.
The goal is to improve language models to better approximate human next-word predictions.

Main components:
- Data processing for Cloze datasets
- GPT-2 model fine-tuning
- Perplexity evaluation and comparison
- Visualization utilities
